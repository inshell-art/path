# AGENTS (scripts/)

Overrides root guidance:
- Scripts are bash; run with `bash` if unsure.
- Devnet scripts moved to `../localnet/scripts/` and `../localnet/scripts/devnet/`.
- Keep script behavior stable; avoid refactors unless explicitly requested.
- Sepolia flow uses `scripts/declare-sepolia.sh` and `scripts/deploy-sepolia.sh` with outputs in `output/sepolia/`.
